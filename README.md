# Cuisine-Detection
Formulated a model using classifiers like Multi-class SVMs and deep learning techniques for categorizing and detecting a dish's cuisine type (Indian, Italian, etc.), by analyzing its ingredients list.

Steps :

# Feature Extraction / Data Pre-processing

# Implementing the Naive Bayes Algorithm (used as a benchmark)
# Multi-class SVM
– Linear Kernel
– RBF Kernel
# Further Improvement in Feature Extraction
# ANN
